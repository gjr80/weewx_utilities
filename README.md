# My WeeWX Utilities #

## Description ##

A collection of various services, search list extensions, utilities and add-ons that I have used with weeWX.

## Warranty ##

I make no warranty that any of the code in this repo will do anything useful or otherwise. Whilst I have tried to keep the various pieces of code generic in nature in most cases the code was written for my specific needs and setup.

## Support ##

I make no guarantee that I can or will support any of this code, I am happy to answer questions where I can. The best thing is to raise an issue or (preferred) ask a question through the weewx-user Google Group.
